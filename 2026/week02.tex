\begin{theorem} 
	Let $f:R \to S$ be a homomorphism of rings, Then 
	\begin{align*}
		&\text{(1)}\quad f(0_R) = 0_S \\
		&\text{(2)}\quad f(-a) = -f(a) \quad \forall a \in R \\
		&\text{(3)}\quad f(a - b) = f(a) - f(b) \quad \forall a,b \in R
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem} 
\begin{proof} 
	(1) As $f$ is a homomorphism of rings, we have the following: 
	\begin{align*} 
		f(0_R) + f(0_R) &= f(0_R + 0_R) \\
		f(0_R) + f(0_R) &= f(0_R) \quad [0_R + 0_R = 0_R \,\text{in} \, R] \\
		f(0_R) + f(0_R) & = f(0_R) + 0_S \, [f(0_R) + 0_S = f(0_R)\, \text{in} \, S] \\
		f(0_R) &= 0_S
	\end{align*} 

	(2) Note that: $f(a) + f(-a) = f(a + (-a)) = f(0_R) = 0_S$ by (1) and $f$ is a homomorphism. So, $f(-a)$ is a solution to the equation $f(a) + x = 0_S$. But as $S$ is a ring, there exists only one unique solution to this equation which is $-f(a)$. Therefore by [theorem to be proved at a later date], $f(-a) = -f(a)$. 

	(3) As $f$ is a homomorphism and by (2), we have the following: 
	\begin{align*}
		f(a - b) &= f(a + (-b)) \\
		&= f(a) + f(-b) \\
		&= f(a) - f(b) 
	\end{align*} 
\end{proof}
