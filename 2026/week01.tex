\begin{theorem} 
	If $a | c$ and $b | c$ and $\gcd(a, b) = d$, then $ab | cd$. $a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	As $d = \gcd(a, b)$, we have that $d = au + bv$ for some $u, v \in \mathbb{Z}$. We now have that $cd = c(au + bv) = cau + cbv$. Since $a | c$ and $b | c$, $c = ax = by$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$. Substituing $c$ results in $cd = cau +cbv = (by)au + (ax)bv = (ab)(yu + xv)$. As $u, v, x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$, $yu +xv \in \mathbb{Z}$. By definition of divisibility, $ab | cd$.

%\begin{theorem}
%	Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, not both $0$, and let $d$ be their greatest common divisor. Then there exists (not necessarily unique) integers $u$ and $v$ such that $d = au + bv$.
